              <h3 align="left">TESDA sets 14-Point Reform and Development Agenda</h3>
              <p align="left">Mamondiong announces programs for expanded and equal access to training</p>
              <p align="left">2 September 2016 </p>
              <p align="left">Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) Director General, Secretary Guiling &ldquo;Gene&rdquo; A. Mamondiong today announced the agency&rsquo;s programs that it expects will result in poverty reduction and decent employment opportunities.<br />
                <br />
                In what he refers to as the &ldquo;TESDA 14-point Reform and Development Agenda&rdquo;, the following programs have been identified: 1. Barangay-based Scholarship Program; 2. On-line Scholarship Application; 3. Technical Audit of TVET Schools and Programs; 4. Skills Training for Drug Dependents; 5. Skills Training for Entrepreneurs and Family Enterprises; 6. Skills Training Program for Inmates and their Families; 7. Inclusive Training Program for Women; 8. Continuing Program for TESDA&rsquo;s Alumni; 9. Global Access to/on-line database of TVET Graduates and Certified Workers; 10. Linkages with Agro-Industry; 11. Linkages with State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs); 12. Linkages with Foreign Skills Training Institutions; 13. Transparency; and, 14. Moral Renewal.<br />
                <br />
                &ldquo;We are confident that these programs will help empower our people to become more productive members of society.  These will give them opportunities through skills training that can either help them start a career or a new business venture,&rdquo; said the TESDA Chief.</p>
              <p align="left">Of the 14 programs, TESDA has already started the first phase of the Barangay-based Scholarship Program or &ldquo;Barangay Kasanayan para sa Kabuhayan at Kapayapaan&rdquo; (BKKK), having written to the heads of the more than 42,000 barangays in the country to gather data on the training programs that are most needed in their respected areas.<br />
                <br />
                &ldquo;BKKK aims to give equal opportunity to our countrymen who have little access to skills training.  We intend to offer them programs that will directly respond to the skills requirements and employment opportunities in their localities,&rdquo; added Sec. Mamondiong.<br />
                <br />
                Meanwhile, Technical Audit of TVET Schools and Programs is already underway beginning with the National Capital Region to ensure continuing compliance of TVET providers, both public and private, to the standards set by the industry. The agency&rsquo;s Chief said that particular attention will be given to the availability and adequacy of relevant training facilities, tools and equipment of all institutions offering tech-voc programs.<br />
                <br />
                Special skills training programs will also be given priority for drug dependents, inmates and women to empower them and expand their opportunities for social and economic development.<br />
                <br />
                For the next six years, the agency will also strengthen its efforts in building linkages with SUCs and LUCs as well as with foreign skills training institutions not only to widen training opportunities, particularly for the marginalized sectors, but also to ensure that the most modern technologies are accessible for our workforce so that the competencies they gain is kept at par with international standards.<br />
                <br />
                Speeding up processes and assuring good governance is likewise a key for the success and meaningful impact of TESDA&rsquo;s programs and services. To ensure this, the agency will soon establish its on-line scholarship application system and the on-line database of TVET graduates certified workers.<br />
                <br />
                According to Mamondiong, the 14-point agenda serves as the framework for designing programs that would cater specifically to the needs of identified groups such as: urban &amp; rural poor, farmers, fisher folks, indigenous people (IPs), women, rebel returnees/combatants, drug dependents, repatriated OFWs, out-of-school youths (OSYs), micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), family enterprises, and local government units (LGUs).<br />
                <br />
                The agency also has new campaigns conceptualized in line with the administration&rsquo;s urgent call for the prevention of illegal drug use, massive skills training, and the reduction of red tape and corruption.  These include: introducing drug abuse prevention and control topics during orientations for TVET trainees; providing skills training and assessment to rehabilitated drug abuse victims and their immediate family members; streamlining of program registration, assessment and certification processes; incentives scheme to safeguard against anomalous and corrupt acitvities; and promoting efficiency, honesty and integrity.<br />
                <br />
                TESDA had earlier unveiled its &ldquo;Two-pronged Direction of TESDA in Poverty Reduction&rdquo; which repositions technical vocational education and training (TVET) towards a two-pronged strategy: TVET for global competitiveness and TVET for social equity.  Tech-voc training has contributed to both economic growth and social equity by providing productive and employable skills needed by industries, communities and individuals.  These are all aimed at developing a productive, world-class workforce to achieve sustainable inclusive growth. </p>
