        The Asian Technical-Vocational Education Resource Center (ATVERC) is a project of the National Institute for Technical Education and Skills Development (NITESD) of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority which aims to  revive and rejuvenate the operation of Learning Resource Centers (LRC) in the Philippines and provide services as seen in the &quot;Library of Commons&quot;. <br />
        <br />
      Researchers and students may come to the ATVERC to explore the facility and gain access to resources with ease using in-house computer workstations or personal gadgets such as tablets and smartphones.<br />

        The Learning Resource Center concept was introduced in 2003 by the National Institute for Technical Vocational Education and Training (NITVET) as a functional area of the Competency-Based Training approach adopted by TESDA. This became part of the TESD Project under the Courseware Development sub-component and was mainly used to provide training support materials to various technical/vocational institutions. The central office through the TESD Project continually provided regional LRCs with support materials i.e., reference books, training manuals, video/audio tapes and staff training on LRC Management. In the year 2010, the LRC distributed the final batch of reference materials to identified Centers of Technical Excellence (CenTEx) composed of some TESDA training centers and selected TESDA-supervised schools.<br />
        <br />
        LRC then was operated as a unit of the Curriculum and Training Aid Division (CTAD) with three  staff including a licensed librarian. It functioned as a special library that  supported book reading, video viewing, audio listening, and computer services  for research work, internet, and interactive courseware training. The staff  organized the collections making sure that everything is in place plus  additional tasks of updating the electronic database, publishing lists of  current collections and maintaining archives of agency publications.</p>

DESCRIPTION  OF THE PROJECT 
        <blockquote>          
          <p>The Asian Technical Vocational Education Resource Center shall serve as the hub of TVET e-resources in the  country. Most of the content will come from online resources identified as  weblinks and the rest are shared training resources from the TESDA training institutions. <br />
            <br />
      Existing TESDA publications  will be selected, digitized  and organized into a database. Selection will be based on the criteria of usefulness to researchers such as reports, plans, researches, studies and other publications.</p>
